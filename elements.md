<p>I'm a senior at Clarkson University studying a dual degree in Innovation & Entrepreneurship and Communications. It's been a long way coming but I'm proud to say that I will be graduating in May 2019! After graduation, I plan on doing something in either UX design or marketing. However, I don't like to stay in a box so I'm interested in other positions that relate to my degrees. At the end of the day, I want to have impactful and meaningful work so that when I kick my shoes off at 5pm I feel like I made a difference.</p>
